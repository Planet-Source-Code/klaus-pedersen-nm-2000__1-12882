### Description

- THE SEND MESSAGE WORKS UNDER WINDOWS 2000 -

- BUT THE FUNCTIONS SHOULD WORK ON ANY VERSION OF WINDOWS!!! -

This is a Network "chat" client, which is using the NET SEND command to send messages to your network

friends, and you don't have to open a DOS Window, NM 2000 does it all for you!!! The only thing, you have

to do, is to type the receivers network name and write a message, and hit send!!!

Also uses the features of being able to show you the free disk space, CPU type, number of CPUs installed,

how to make hyperlinks, making a slide-show when exiting the program,

your Windows version PLUS also shows you how much memory currently available to your system!!!

This program comes with FULL source code, and you should check it, I would say that it's a MUST SEE!

If you like it, PLEASE DO vote for it, and I'll appreciate every vote!!!

If you don't use Windows 2000, you should try it anyway!!

I've got some very interesting code in this, as you can read above!!!

I've got some quite interesting plans with this, and maybe YOU can help me making them reality?

Contact me at: nmb13978@vip.cybercity.dk and let's talk about it or on ICQ: 53099224!

### More Info
 
The Send Message code works on Win 2000 only, but all other effects and functions should work just fine on Win 9x!!!
